# Coach-Booking-System

It is made on Java Netbeans.

This Bus Ticket Management System is a JAVA based application for the booking of Bus ticket.

It is an offline management system. In this you can signup, login and can even change your password. This appplication provides the use of GUI using Swings in JAVA. Many JAR files are present in it to help it easily accomodate date and many other pallete tools. This apllication lets you see tickets booked through your phone number (not actual but just stored in database when you purchase ticket).

You can select various buses for a selected route.(This feature might not work as I am providing the database but may or may not export in you database.)
